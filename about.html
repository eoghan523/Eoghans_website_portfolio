    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Eoghan. I am originally from Northern Ireland, currently living in Basingstoke. My previous experience as a Network Engineer has given me a deep understanding of Networking  OSI Layers 1-4. By the end of this skills bootcamp, I am hoping understand coding, full stack development and gain employment as a developer in the future.  </p>
    
<P>In my spare time I enjoy travelling. I recently embarked on a 4 week roadtrip across Arizona, Utah, Nevada and New Mexico. Below is a picture of me on Horseshoe bend in Arzona. I will add a few more photos of my travels.</P>
